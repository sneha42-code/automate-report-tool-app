                The Attrition Analysis Tool helps HR professionals and business
                leaders understand employee departure patterns and make
                data-driven decisions to improve retention. This documentation
                will guide you through using the tool effectively.

                Our tool analyzes your HRIS data to provide insights across
                multiple dimensions including gender, location, function,
                tenure, and grade levels. The generated report includes
                visualizations and statistics to help you identify concerning
                trends and focus areas.

                Your generated report contains several sections providing
                comprehensive analysis of attrition patterns. Here's what to
                look for in each section:

                  <h3>1. Overall Attrition Statistics</h3>
                  <p>
                    This section provides a high-level view of your
                    organization's attrition, including total employee count,
                    total exits, and overall attrition rate. The pie chart
                    visualizes the proportion of active vs. exited employees.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Key insight:</strong> Compare your overall attrition
                    rate with industry benchmarks to understand if your
                    retention is better or worse than average.

                  <h3>2. Gender-wise Attrition</h3>
                  <p>
                    This analysis breaks down attrition by gender, showing if
                    there are disproportionate departure rates between different
                    genders. The section includes counts, rates, and
                    visualizations.

                  <p>
                    <strong>Key insight:</strong> Significant differences in

                    diversity and inclusion issues that need addressing.

                    locations with significant employee populations (â‰¥50
                    employees). It helps identify if certain locations
                    experience higher turnover.

                    This analysis examines attrition by functional area or
                    department, showing which areas experience higher turnover.
                    It's limited to functions with â‰¥20 employees for statistical
                    relevance.

                    This section examines how long employees stay before
                    leaving, grouped into tenure bands (&lt;1 year, 1-2 years,
                    etc.). It helps identify critical retention periods where
                    focused interventions might be needed.

                    levels, helping you understand if turnover is higher at
                    certain career stages.

                    What if my data doesn't have all the required columns?
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    The tool requires all the specified columns to function
                    properly. If your data is missing certain fields, consider
                    enriching your dataset before uploading. You might need to
                    consult with your HR information system administrator.

                  <h3>How can I interpret the attrition percentages?</h3>
                  <p>
                    Attrition percentages represent the proportion of employees
                    who have left relative to the total employees in that
                    category. Industry benchmarks vary, but typically annual
                    attrition rates of 10-15% are considered average in many
                    sectors. Rates significantly above this may indicate
                    retention issues.

                  <h3>Can I customize the report sections?</h3>
                  <p>
                    The current version generates a standard report with all
                    sections. In future updates, we plan to add customization
                    options to allow users to select specific sections.

                  <h3>How large can my dataset be?</h3>
                  <p>
                    The tool is optimized to handle datasets of up to 10,000
                    employees. Larger datasets may require additional processing
                    time or custom solutions. Contact us if you need to analyze
                    very large datasets.
